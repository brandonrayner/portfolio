Battlegrid for mundane task? Harvest trees/rocks/etc, traverse hazards. Not just for combat.
Characters with varied skills and not just all combat focused. Like Etrian Odyssey with mine/chop/take skills, but more than just harvesting. Speed/Jump/Build

Turnbased mode (combat) and no-pressure mode (obstacle)

continuous dungeon? one long dungeon with every feature, automate until party falls, playback of failed fight
smaller dungeons to farm resources, over time generation based on performance

procedural generation and seed selection?
depths get harder to ensure it's difficult to run infinitely; to a cap (early game areas should be easier to farm and might allow it?)
default seed at each tier that always has at least one of a resource; but low overall

Battle cycle
- Farm, return, rest, repeat
- HP, Stamina, MP; when any resource runs out, return home (team HP? team Stamina?)
- Different resting periods for different resources? (HP most; Stamina least)
- Probably don't do the gambits in v1

3 categories:
Traversal - hazard, gap, climb
Combat
Harvest
